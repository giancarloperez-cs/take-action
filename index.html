<h1> Welcome to Fresh Access! </h1>
<p> My main goal throughout this project is to spread awareness in my community about eating healthy through methods such as an application/webpage that allows for a streamlined process when it comes to picking what foods you would like to eat depending on where you shop. This ensures that users will actually go through with their decision of trying to eat healthy on a budget, due to the nature of the app/website being very direct when it comes to giving them options based on their input. </p>
